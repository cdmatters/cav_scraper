**What:**

This program is designed to help you pull all the files you want 
off TiS, exam papers or handouts, while putting them down in your
your computer in a pretty and organised way. 

It also keeps track 
of what youâ€™ve downloaded, and therefore can pick up where it left 
off, if you get interrupted halfway through.  

**Why:**

Hopefully this should help the last minute panic you normally end
up getting around exam time, downloading 8 past papers for 8 
different courses, trying to organise the folders so you can find 
them again etc.

It's also for any people just about to graduate
(or already have) and are wanting a way to keep a record of say, 
all of 2015 physics handouts for posterity (and future reference).

**Requirements**
+ Beautiful Soup 4: 
+ Requests: 
+ also: *CREATE: keys.py* in main directory

    ```
    #keys.py
    user = "Valid User" 
    user_raven = "vus91"
    password =  "UrPa55wd"
    ```

There are further, clearer instructions for installation and running this program in the READ_ME.txt, if required by the user.

Enjoy! xxELLH


(PS note I always advocate using a virtual environment for packages
like this but thats your call, if you want one)
(PPS get the Pt III Quantum Information book! Its great!)
