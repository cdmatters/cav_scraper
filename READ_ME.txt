This is the READ_ME to be read before running CavScraper for the
first time.

WHAT:
This program is designed to help you pull all the files you want 
off TiS, exam papers or handouts, while putting them down in your
your computer in a pretty and organised way. It also keeps track 
of what you’ve downloaded, and therefore can pick up where it left 
off, if you get interrupted halfway through.  

WHY:
Hopefully this should help the last minute panic you normally end
up getting around exam time, downloading 8 past papers for 8 
different courses, trying to organise the folders so you can find 
them again etc, or even for any people just about to graduate
(or already have) and are wanting a way to keep a record of say, 
all of 2015 physics handouts for posterity (and future reference).

GET STARTED:
However, before you start this program requires two libraries to be
downloaded.  These can be installed using ‘pip’, which is a library
handler. It takes two seconds to download and install, and is vital
if you ever fancy doing a bit of coding in python anyway.

(SO): ‘http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17271319/installing-pip-on-mac-os-x'
Pip: ‘https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html#install-or-upgrade-pip'

Then you need to pip install the libraries:
-Beautiful Soup 4:  (bash: >>> pip install beautifulsoup4)
-Requests:  (bash: >>> pip install requests)

FINALLY:
This program requires an active physics raven id. Open ‘keys.py’
in any text editor and put in your user details

NOW RUN:
navigate to this folder/directory in terminal. 
then its simply type in terminal: (bash: >>> python run.py)

Enjoy! xxELLH


(PS note I always advocate using a virtual environment for packages
like this but thats your call, if you want one)
(PPS get the Pt III Quantum Information book! Its great!)
